#Supported Materials. 

We provide with original and rewrited apps, taint-flow analysis results and case studies screenshot for reproduction.
The dummy repository for anonymous submission.

##BenchApps
Contains original and rewrited apps from benchmark test.

We also present an ICFG and taint-flow-graph demo for button1.apk

##Cases

Inlcude original and rewrited apps, the virus-total report and results from taint-flow analysis

###Case1

We prevent the privacy leakage insert a dummy deviceID.

##Other Cases
We also provide other cases for demonstrate the UCer's usablity than current android dynamic permissions and TaintDroid.

###Better than Android dynamic permission

###Better than taintDroid
